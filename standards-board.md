The APEX Standards board represents the top leadership within the APEX and APRS community. The primary function of the board is not to dictate standards for the community but rather to evaluate community consensus, contributions, and opinions so as to determine which standards are likely to gain wide-spread acceptance.

A position on the board will be extended to any project member who has demonstrated continued contributions to the project and a well understood knowledge of the APRS and APEX systems. The hope is that members of the community will look to the board members, the core team, as mentors and domain experts able to help guide the public discussions. A global mesh network will only work when the entire community can cooperate.
