Any member of the community is encouraged to participate in conversations regarding RFC proposals, as well as contribute software patches to the APEX reference implementation for experimentation and ultimately acceptance into the main project. A position on the board will be extended to any project member who has demonstrated continued contributions to the project and a well understood knowledge of the APRS and APEX systems. The hope is that members of the community will look to the board members, the core team, as mentors and domain experts able to help guide the public discussions. A global mesh network will only work when the entire community can cooperate.
