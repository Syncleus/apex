Any member of the community is encouraged to participate in conversations regarding RFC proposals, as well as contribute software patches to the APEX reference implementation for experimentation and ultimately acceptance into the main project. Ultimately approval comes once the community has voices all the perspectives and consensus has been acheived by the entire community.

If consensus can not be reached in the community, and all options have been discussed, then a solution will be reached that attempts to reach a compromise between the availing opinions within the community. This is where the role of the Standards Board comes in, acting as a mediator and ultimately used to arrive at a democratic resolution. No one individual should have the power when it comes to deciding the standards that effect the entire community.
