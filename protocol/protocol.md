The APEX protocol defines the specificiation with which all APEX complient
stations must adhere to. It defines both the on-air format of APEX packets as
well as the behavior with which complient stations will exhibit when handling
APEX and APRS packets. All APEX complient stations are expected to use the
[APEX Paradigm](/paradigm/), which should be built-in to any software designed
to be APEX complient out of the box. Despite this non-APEX complient software
can still run the APEX Paradigm but this would only allow for partial
complience with the new network. For this reason the APEX Paradigm is considered
seperate, though related, to the APEX Protocol.
